<pre>TO INSALL SEEDLESS:
1: Get the neodatis i2pupdate.zip, copy it to your i2p install directory.
2: Restart your router.
3: Get the Seedless i2pupdate.zip, copy it to your i2p install directory.
4: Restart your router.


Seedless console is at http://127.0.0.1:7657/SeedlessConsole/

You won't have to update neodatis unless there is a newer version posted.
You are fully welcome to get and unpack neodatis for yourself from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/neodatis-odb/files/
Be sure to use 2.1.beta12-180 (12-01-2010-09-08-37) or newer. 
I'll try to keep up with what is there for the 2.x series.

Something went wrong/FAQ:

Q1: Where did my router console go?
A1: You have an ancient wrapper.config.
     remove all lines containing wrapper.java.classpath.x and put in a
     single one that reads 
         wrapper.java.classpath.1=/path/to/installed/i2p/lib/*.jar
     On win32, the default for this is
         wrapper.java.classpath.1=C:\Program Files\i2p/lib/*.jar
       That's no typo either, the slashes go this and that way :-D
      On linux/unix type default installs, the default is one of the following:
         wrapper.java.classpath.1=/usr/local/i2p/lib/*.jar
        or
         wrapper.java.classpath.1=/opt/i2p/lib/*.jar

Q2: I see stuff about can't find neodatis jar, and/or seedlesscore jar files
    in wrapper.log!
A2: See A1, above.

Q3: http://127.0.0.1:7657/SeedlessConsole/ doesn't work!
A3: Check your wrapper.log, and see A1, above.

TO RUN A SEEDLESS SERVER OR HIDDEN EEPSITE:

1: Shut down your router completely.
2: In a text editor, edit i2ptunnel.config, and locate the tunnel containing
    your eepsite.
3: Add/change the lines to the correct tunnel... see notes below.
4: Be sure you can actually run webapps.... see notes below about jetty.xml
5: double check that your tunnel is the new bidir version of the http server
   from the router console and that it is up and running and that it is started
   automatically at startup.
6: drop Seedless.war AND/OR EepAnnouncer.war into your webapps dir (eepsite/webapps)
7: Start your router.
8: Watch your wrapper log for information.



||||| NOTE |||||
Classic installs:
Everything where you installed. If you lack a.i2p directory in your home dir, 
then you have the classic installation.

Newer installs:
The config files are located under ~/.i2p/
So, for example, if you run i2p as root, the config files are at /root/.i2p/
If you run it as user sponge, it would be under /home/sponge/.i2p/

For windows newer installs, aparently the files are in %APPDATA%\I2P\


||||| NOTES on i2ptunnel.config |||||
CHANGE type=httpserver to type=httpbidirserver
CHANGE startOnLoad=false to startOnLoad=true
ADD interface=127.0.0.1
ADD listenPort=4488


||||| NOTES on eepsite/jetty.xml |||||
Find a section that looks like this:
  &lt;Set name="rootWebApp"&gt;root&lt;/Set&gt;
  &lt;!-- UNCOMMENT TO ACTIVATE
  &lt;Call name="addWebApplications"&gt;
    &lt;Arg&gt;&lt;/Arg&gt;
    &lt;Arg&gt;./eepsite/webapps/&lt;/Arg&gt;
    &lt;Arg&gt;&lt;/Arg&gt;
    &lt;Arg type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/Arg&gt;
  &lt;/Call&gt;
  --&gt;
  

and make it look like this:
  &lt;!-- UNCOMMENT TO ACTIVATE --&gt;
  &lt;Call name="addWebApplications"&gt;
    &lt;Arg&gt;&lt;/Arg&gt;
    &lt;Arg&gt;./eepsite/webapps/&lt;/Arg&gt;
    &lt;Arg&gt;&lt;/Arg&gt;
    &lt;Arg type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/Arg&gt;
    &lt;Arg type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/Arg&gt;
    &lt;Arg&gt;
      &lt;Array type="java.lang.String"&gt;
        &lt;Item&gt;i2p.b32&lt;/Item&gt;
              &lt;!-- your b32 address here --&gt;
        &lt;Item&gt;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.b32.i2p&lt;/Item&gt;
      &lt;/Array&gt;
    &lt;/Arg&gt;
  &lt;/Call&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;


*******IMPORTANT*********
Be sure that you remove or fix BOTH LINES 
            "&lt;!-- UNCOMMENT TO ACTIVATE" and "--&gt;"
            if you have them! SOME installations will not.

Be sure to set *YOUR* b32.i2p address!!!  
            DO-NOT include the "http://" or the trailing "/"
